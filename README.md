# Advanced Email Generator

A modern, responsive webpage that generates email address variations from a single primary email. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool offers a sleek design and practical functionality for creating disposable or alternative email addresses.

## Overview

The Advanced Email Generator takes a user's primary email address and creates multiple variations using different techniques such as dot insertion, plus tags, subdomains, and more. Each generated email comes with a "Copy" button for easy clipboard access, making it ideal for testing, organization, or privacy purposes.

## Benefits

- **Email Privacy:** Create disposable email variations to protect your primary email from spam or tracking.
- **Organization:** Use variations for filtering emails (e.g., `john+work@gmail.com` for work-related messages).
- **Versatility:** Supports multiple variation types including:
  - Dot variations (e.g., `j.o.h.n@domain.com`)
  - Plus variations (e.g., `john+variant@domain.com`)
  - Subdomain variations (e.g., `john@mail.domain.com`)
  - Number variations (e.g., `john1@domain.com`)
  - Prefix/suffix variations (e.g., `my.john@domain.com`)
  - Alternative domains (e.g., `john@googlemail.com` for Gmail users)
- **User-Friendly:** Modern design with box shadows, smooth transitions, and responsive layout.
- **Convenience:** One-click copy functionality for each generated email.
- **Validation:** Ensures input is a properly formatted email address before generating variations.

## Features

- **Input Validation:** Checks for valid email format using regex.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Visual Feedback:** Buttons change to "Copied!" with a color shift after copying.
- **Modern Styling:** Gradient background, rounded corners, and subtle box shadows for depth.
- **No Dependencies:** Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—no external libraries required.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)
- No server setup needed—just open the HTML file locally or host it on a web server.

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/advanced-email-generator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd advanced-email-generator
   ```

### Running the Webpage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser:
   - Double-click the file, or
   - Use a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or VS Code's Live Server extension) for best results.
2. Alternatively, deploy to a web host for online access.

### How to Use
1. **Enter Your Email:**
   - Type your primary email address into the input field (e.g., `john.doe@gmail.com`).
2. **Generate Variations:**
   - Click the "Generate Email Variations" button.
   - If the email is invalid, an error message will appear.
3. **View Results:**
   - A list of email variations will display below the form.
4. **Copy an Email:**
   - Click the "Copy" button next to any variation to copy it to your clipboard.
   - The button will change to "Copied!" for 2 seconds as confirmation.

### Example
- Input: `john.doe@gmail.com`
- Output:
  - `j.o.h.n.d.o.e@gmail.com`
  - `john.doe+variant@gmail.com`
  - `john.doe@mail.gmail.com`
  - `john.doe1@gmail.com`
  - `my.john.doe@gmail.com`
  - `john.doe.extra@gmail.com`
  - `john.doe@googlemail.com`

## Notes
- **Compatibility:** Some email providers (like Gmail) ignore dots and plus tags, treating variations as the same inbox. Others may treat them as separate addresses—test accordingly.
- **Customization:** Edit the `generateEmails` function in `index.html` to add or modify variation types.
- **Enhancements:** Consider adding randomization or user-defined tags for more flexibility.
